A color scientist and senior imaging engineer with ten years shaping how moving-picture color is captured, computed, and delivered. I work from the first photo-electron on the sensor to the last photon off a screen, making sure every stage of the imaging chain works to preserve and shape color as data *and* story.

At ARRI I served on the color science team for the *ALEXA 35*, helping develop the **REVEAL Color Science** architecture (LogC4 and the accompanying scene-to-display transforms). Earlier, at Double Negative and Sony Pictures Imageworks, I built studio-wide color management workflows, migrated facilities to **OpenColorIO**, and supported titles such as *TENET* and *Spider-Man: Homecoming* through scene-referred color pipelines.

Day-to-day I design matrices and 3D LUTs, author tone and gamut mapping algorithms in **Python** and **Julia**, and build production-scale software for high-end cinematography and computer animation. I contribute to the **ACES** and OpenColorIO open source projects and translate between optics, code, and the grading suite so artists can focus on intent rather than infrastructure.

My north star is **longevity**: the look approved today should remain faithful as cameras, displays, codecs, and workflows evolve.

Precision today. Patina tomorrow.
